            <h2>Welcome To My Little World</h2>
            <p>Originating from Noakhali, Bangladesh, I am a dedicated researcher with a strong passion for geography, hydrology, and environmental sustainability. My work focuses on addressing water-related challenges, particularly in flood-prone regions, through advanced GIS, remote sensing, and hydrodynamic modeling.</p>
            <p>I am known for my curiosity, adaptability, and collaborative spirit. I love tackling complex environmental problems and am constantly exploring new geospatial tools and data analysis techniques to make a positive impact. In my free time, I enjoy playing cricket and exploring ways to connect my interests with my commitment to community resilience.</p>
            <p>Let's explore my journey, research, and insights</p>
